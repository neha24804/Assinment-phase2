        <p>
            Ernakulam refers to the eastern, mainland portion of the twin cities of Ernakulam-Kochi in central Kerala, India. Located on the coast of the Arabian Sea, Ernakulam is a booming business metropolis.
            It is often referred to as the commercial capital of Kerala. Ernakulam has been a part of human settlements since the Stone Age.
            Rock-cut caves and dolmens are still a part of this city. Ernakulam was ruled by the Chera Dynasty and later, by the Kingdom of Cochin (Perumpadapu Swaroopam). 
            Soaked in history and the many different grandeurs of Kerala, Ernakulam is one of the most stunning destinations in God’s Own Country! 
            The once a capital of the Kingdom of Cochin, this township is a major commercial area in Kochi and is also called the ‘Commercial Capital of Kerala’.
            While the existence of this city dates back to the Stone Age, today it is revered to have the most electrifying ambience in the entire country. 
            Ancient, yet with modern charm, Ernakulam also serves as a throbbing hub for budding entrepreneurs and also contributes significantly to the state’s tourism industry.
